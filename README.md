## 📚 Learning Modules

### 1. Cursor AI Setup (45 min)
Learn to install and use the AI-powered code editor
- Download and install Cursor
- Configure AI features
- Create your first project
- Master keyboard shortcuts

### 2. GitHub Integration (60 min)
Master version control and collaboration
- Create GitHub account
- Install and configure Git
- Create repositories
- Push code to GitHub
- Collaboration workflows

### 3. Netlify Deployment (45 min)
Deploy your website with continuous deployment

### 4. Supabase Backend (90 min)
Build a full-stack app with backend services
- Create Supabase project
- Design database schema
- Set up authentication
- Query your database
- Real-time features
- Row Level Security

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The platform uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with the following tables:

- **`users_profile`** - Extended user information
- **`modules`** - Learning modules
- **`steps`** - Individual learning steps
- **`user_progress`** - Progress tracking per user
- **`messages`** - Community message board

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for data protection.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with GitHub"
2. Redirected to GitHub OAuth authorization
3. GitHub returns user to Supabase callback
4. Supabase creates user session
5. User profile automatically created via database trigger
6. User redirected to dashboard with active session

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Modern Interface** - Clean, professional design
- **Smooth Animations** - Polished user experience
- **Progress Indicators** - Visual feedback on completion
- **Intuitive Navigation** - Easy to find and access content
- **Dark Mode Ready** - Color variables for easy theming

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy to Netlify

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy AI Classroom"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Deploy!

3. **Update GitHub OAuth**
   - Add your Netlify URL to GitHub OAuth app
   - Update callback URLs

See [AUTH_SETUP.md](AUTH_SETUP.md) for complete deployment instructions.

## 🔒 Security

### Best Practices Implemented
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ Secure authentication via Supabase Auth
- ✅ OAuth tokens never exposed to client
- ✅ API keys properly scoped (using anon key)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Supabase client

### What to Protect
- ⚠️ Never commit `service_role` key to Git
- ⚠️ Always use `anon` key in frontend code
- ⚠️ Keep RLS policies strict and tested
- ⚠️ Validate user input before database operations

## 🎓 For Teachers

### Customizing Content

1. **Add/Edit Modules**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO modules (slug, title, description, order_number)
   VALUES ('new-module', 'New Module', 'Description', 5);
   ```

2. **Add/Edit Steps**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO steps (module_id, slug, title, order_number, estimated_minutes)
   VALUES (1, 'new-step', 'New Step', 5, 15);
   ```

3. **View Student Progress**
   - Use the `user_progress_summary` view in Supabase
   - Export data for analytics
   - Track completion rates

### Analytics Queries

**See overall completion rates:**
```sql
SELECT 
  m.title,
  COUNT(DISTINCT up.user_id) as students_started,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN up.status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completions
FROM modules m
LEFT JOIN user_progress up ON up.module_id = m.id
GROUP BY m.id, m.title;
```

**See individual student progress:**
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  m.title as module,
  COUNT(s.id) as total_steps,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN up.status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed
FROM users_profile u
CROSS JOIN modules m
LEFT JOIN steps s ON s.module_id = m.id
LEFT JOIN user_progress up ON up.user_id = u.id AND up.step_id = s.id
GROUP BY u.id, u.email, m.id, m.title;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Supabase not configured"**
- Check that `config.js` has your credentials
- Verify credentials are correct

**"redirect_uri_mismatch"**
- Update GitHub OAuth callback URL
- Make sure it matches Supabase callback exactly

**Progress not saving**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're signed in
- Check RLS policies in Supabase

**Can't sign in**
